Consider the following example as a precursor to a question:

1. Gather ingredients: flour, eggs
2. [Missing Step]
3. Mix the whisked eggs with the flour.

In this example, for "whisked eggs" to be added to the "flour," the eggs must first be cracked and whisked.
Therefore, these steps are dependent because the state of the "eggs" must change before they can be mixed with the
"flour."

For the following plan and question, return ONLY 0 if the pair in question is non-dependent and 1 if pair is dependent.
Again, your response should only be either a 0 or 1.
